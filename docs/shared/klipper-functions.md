## Normal Operation

### `NFC_GATE_STATUS`

Shows the NFC_Manager's last known state for every gate. This is an in-memory snapshot — it is not a live I2C read.

```gcode
NFC_GATE_STATUS
```

Example output:
```
NFC gate status  (5 gates configured):
  Gate 0  [lane0]:  empty
  Gate 1  [lane1]:  empty
  Gate 4  [lane4]:  spool 43     UID 04456192D32A81
```

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STATUS=1`

Same as `NFC_GATE_STATUS` but for a single lane.

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane4 STATUS=1
```

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> INIT=1`

Runs the PN532 initialization sequence: wakeup → `GetFirmwareVersion` → `SAMConfiguration`.

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 INIT=1
```

**When to use:** After first wiring, after a failed startup, or after flashing lane MCU firmware.

Expected success:
```
NFC_GATE[lane0]: reader OK
```

If this fails, see [Troubleshooting](../i2c-pn532/troubleshooting.md).

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> SCAN=1`

Reads the PN532 hardware once and prints the raw tag UID. Does not look up Spoolman and does not update Happy Hare.

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 SCAN=1
```

**When to use:**
- Getting a UID to register in Spoolman
- Confirming a reader can physically see a tag
- Checking whether a wiring or mode problem is fixed

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> POLL=1`

Runs one complete cycle of the NFC manager pipeline:

1. PN532 reads the UID
2. NFC_Manager checks if the UID is new, the same, or absent
3. If new: SpoolmanClient looks up the spool ID
4. Gate state updates
5. If state changed: dispatches `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED`, `_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED`, or `_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL`

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 POLL=1
```

**When to use:** Testing the complete pipeline end-to-end, or verifying a specific tag is registered correctly.

Expected output (registered tag):
```
NFC gate 0: spool 42 detected (UID 04AABBCCDD). Sending to Happy Hare.
```

Expected output (unregistered tag):
```
NFC gate 0: tag UID 04AABBCCDD is not registered in Spoolman.
Open the spool record in Spoolman, set the 'rfid_tag' extra field to: 04AABBCCDD
```

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> APPLY=1`

Forces the lane's cached spool assignment through to Happy Hare immediately. Does not read the PN532, does not query Spoolman — it just dispatches:

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=<gate> SPOOL_ID=<cached_id> UID=<cached_uid>
```

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 APPLY=1
```

**When to use:** When a poll or polling cycle already resolved a spool, but Happy Hare didn't update (e.g. it was in a locked state during the scan). If you get "no cached spool_id", run `POLL=1` first.

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> CLEAR_CACHE=1`

Clears the lane's cached spool ID and forces a fresh Spoolman lookup on the next tag read.

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 CLEAR_CACHE=1
```

Clears:
1. The lane's cached spool ID
2. The SpoolmanClient UID cache
3. The PN532 driver's in-memory current-card cache

**When to use:** When you've physically put a different spool in a gate and want the next poll to pick up the new one without waiting for the cache to expire. Also useful if Spoolman data was edited and you want the reader to re-fetch.

`CLEAR=1` is accepted as a shorthand.

---

### `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> READ=1` / `READ=0`

Starts or stops background timer polling on one lane.

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 READ=1    ; start polling
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 READ=0    ; stop polling
```

While polling is running, the lane runs `POLL=1` automatically every `poll_interval` seconds (default: 30). Macro dispatches happen automatically when gate state changes.

---

## Background Polling Setup

For production use, you want all lanes polling automatically. There are two ways to start polling:

**Manually after boot** (default — useful during setup):
```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 READ=1
NFC_GATE NAME=lane1 READ=1
NFC_GATE NAME=lane2 READ=1
NFC_GATE NAME=lane3 READ=1
```

**Automatically on boot** (for set-and-forget operation): Add `startup_polling: 1` to each lane in `pn532_i2C.cfg`. Stagger the startup delays so all readers don't poll at the same moment:

```ini
[nfc_gate lane0]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 0.0

[nfc_gate lane1]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 2.0

[nfc_gate lane2]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 4.0

[nfc_gate lane3]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 6.0
```

---

## Event Macros

These macros live in `nfc_macros.cfg` and are called automatically by NFC_Manager when gate state changes. You don't call these manually during normal operation, but you can call them directly to test the Happy Hare handoff without hardware.

### `_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED`

Fires when a tag UID resolves to a Spoolman spool and the gate state changed.

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=<gate> SPOOL_ID=<id> UID=<uid>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number (integer, matches `mmu_gate` in config)
- `SPOOL_ID` — Spoolman spool ID (integer)
- `UID` — NFC tag UID (hex string)

Default behavior:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID={spool_id} AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
```

This calls Happy Hare's `MMU_GATE_MAP` to update the gate map. `AVAILABLE=1` marks the gate as having filament loaded and ready. `SYNC=1` lets Happy Hare push the update to Spoolman.

---

### `_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED`

Fires after a previously-detected spool is absent for `absent_threshold` consecutive polls.

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED GATE=<gate>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number

Default behavior:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID=-1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
```

Clears the gate in Happy Hare's gate map.

---

### `_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL`

Fires when a tag UID is detected but no matching spool is found in Spoolman.

```gcode
_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL GATE=<gate> UID=<uid>
```

Parameters:
- `GATE` — Happy Hare gate number
- `UID` — the unrecognized tag UID

Default behavior: prints a message to the console with the UID and instructions to register it.

**Optional:** If you want unregistered tags to clear the Happy Hare gate instead of just logging, add this line to the macro body:
```gcode
MMU_GATE_MAP GATE={gate} SPOOLID=-1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1
```

---

## Testing the Happy Hare Handoff Without Hardware

You can test whether the macro-to-Happy-Hare pipeline works by calling the event macros directly:

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_CHANGED GATE=0 SPOOL_ID=42 UID=04AABBCCDD
```

If Happy Hare updates correctly, the pipeline from macro inward is working. If it doesn't, check:
- The macro body in `nfc_macros.cfg`
- Whether `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=... SPOOLID=... AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` is the right syntax for your Happy Hare version
- Whether Happy Hare is in a state that accepts gate map changes (e.g. not mid-print with locks active)

```gcode
_NFC_SPOOL_REMOVED GATE=0
_NFC_TAG_NO_SPOOL GATE=0 UID=04AABBCCDD
```

---

## Customizing the Macros

The event macros are in `~/printer_data/config/NFC/nfc_macros.cfg`. Edit them to match your Happy Hare version.

**All Happy Hare commands must stay inside `nfc_macros.cfg`** — do not put `MMU_GATE_MAP` or other Happy Hare commands in Python. This keeps Happy Hare-facing behavior visible and editable in config without touching Python code.

### Happy Hare commands used by the defaults

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=<n> SPOOLID=<id> AVAILABLE=1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` | Assign a spool to a gate, mark it available, and sync to Spoolman |
| `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=<n> SPOOLID=-1 SYNC=1 QUIET=1` | Clear a gate and sync to Spoolman |

The default macros are designed for Happy Hare with `spoolman_support: push`. `SYNC=1` tells Happy Hare to push the local gate map change to Spoolman. If your Happy Hare version uses different command names or parameters, update the macro body.

## Expert: Low-Level Debug Commands

These commands expose raw PN532 I2C bus access for bring-up debugging. They are hidden by default.

Enable in `nfc_vars.cfg`:

```ini
[nfc_gate]
low_level_debug: True
```

Restart Klipper, then:

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 HELP=1    ; shows all available commands including debug steps
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=WAKEUP` | Send PN532 wake byte |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=FIRMWARE_WRITE` | Send `GetFirmwareVersion` command frame |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=FIRMWARE_ACK` | Read ACK for firmware command |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=FIRMWARE_RESPONSE` | Read and parse firmware response |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=SAM_WRITE` | Send `SAMConfiguration` command |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=PASSIVE_WRITE` | Send `InListPassiveTarget` (scan for tag) |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> STEP=PASSIVE_RESPONSE` | Read raw tag-detect response |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> RAW_READ=1 LEN=<n>` | Raw PN532 transport read |
| `NFC_GATE NAME=<lane> RAW_WRITE=<hex>` | Raw PN532 transport write |

> [!WARNING]
> Low-level commands bypass the normal state machine. Sending the wrong sequence can leave the PN532 in a state where normal polling fails until it is restarted. Use only during manual bring-up. Set `low_level_debug: False` before printing.

See [Expert: Low-Level I2C Debugging](expert-low-level-i2c-debugging.md) for the complete step-by-step bring-up sequence.
