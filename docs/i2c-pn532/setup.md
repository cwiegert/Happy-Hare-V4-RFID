# First-Time Setup

[← Install](../shared/install-uninstall.md) | [Spoolman Setup →](../shared/spoolman-integration.md)

This guide assumes you have:
- [Wired the PN532](wiring.md) readers and set them to I2C mode
- [Installed the software](../shared/install-uninstall.md)
- Rebuilt and flashed Klipper firmware on every lane MCU

If you skipped any of those, do them first.

## Step 1 — Add Includes to `printer.cfg`

Add these three lines in this exact order:

```ini
[include NFC/nfc_vars.cfg]
[include NFC/nfc_macros.cfg]
[include NFC/pn532_i2C.cfg]
```

`nfc_vars.cfg` must come first — it defines the base `[nfc_gate]` section that each `[nfc_gate laneN]` in `pn532_i2C.cfg` inherits from. Reversing the order causes a Klipper config error on startup.

---

## Step 2 — Configure Spoolman

Edit `~/printer_data/config/NFC/nfc_vars.cfg`:

```ini
[nfc_gate]
spoolman_url:      auto
spoolman_rfid_key: rfid_tag
```

| Setting | Value | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `spoolman_url: auto` | Reads URL from Moonraker | Use this when `moonraker.conf` has a `[spoolman]` section |
| `spoolman_url: http://host:7912` | Direct URL | Use when testing, or if `auto` isn't working |
| `spoolman_rfid_key: rfid_tag` | Extra field name | Must match what you create in Spoolman Settings |

See [Spoolman Integration](../shared/spoolman-integration.md) — you need to create the extra field in Spoolman and register each tag UID before spool detection will work.

---

## Step 3 — Configure Lane Hardware

Edit `~/printer_data/config/NFC/pn532_i2C.cfg`. The default file has four lanes; adjust to match your printer:

```ini
[nfc_gate lane0]
mmu_gate:   0
i2c_mcu:    lane0
i2c_bus:    i2c3_PB3_PB4

[nfc_gate lane1]
mmu_gate:   1
i2c_mcu:    lane1
i2c_bus:    i2c3_PB3_PB4
```

| Key | Required | Value |
|---|:---:|---|
| `mmu_gate` | Yes | Happy Hare gate number (0-based integer) |
| `i2c_mcu` | Yes | Klipper MCU name — must match an `[mcu laneN]` in your config |
| `i2c_bus` | Yes | I2C bus name on that MCU — use `i2c3_PB3_PB4` for PB3/PB4 on EBB42 |

> [!NOTE]
> `i2c_mcu` must exactly match the MCU name Klipper uses. These names come from Happy Hare's `mmu_hardware.cfg`, typically `lane0`, `lane1`, etc. A mismatch causes a Klipper startup error.

All polling, timing, and logging settings are inherited from the base `[nfc_gate]` in `nfc_vars.cfg`. Override per-lane only if you need different behavior on a specific lane:

```ini
[nfc_gate lane2]
mmu_gate:   2
i2c_mcu:    lane2
i2c_bus:    i2c3_PB3_PB4
debug:      2              ; verbose logging on this lane only
```

---

## Step 4 — Restart Klipper

```bash
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

Watch the log for NFC startup messages:

```bash
tail -f ~/printer_data/logs/nfc_reader.log
```

Errors at this stage are almost always config typos or a missing/mismatched lane MCU name.

---

## Step 5 — Verify Each Reader

### 1. Check all gates

```gcode
NFC_GATE_STATUS
```

Expected with no tags loaded:
```
NFC gate status  (4 gates configured):
  Gate 0  [lane0]:  empty
  Gate 1  [lane1]:  empty
  Gate 2  [lane2]:  empty
  Gate 3  [lane3]:  empty
```

### 2. Initialize a lane

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 INIT=1
```

This runs the PN532 `GetFirmwareVersion` and `SAMConfiguration` handshake. Expected output:
```
NFC_GATE[lane0]: reader OK
```

If it fails, check [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

### 3. Hardware scan

Hold an NFC tag near the reader, then:

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 SCAN=1
```

The UID prints to the console. This is a raw hardware read — no Spoolman lookup, no Happy Hare update.

### 4. Full pipeline test

With a registered tag (see [Spoolman Integration](../shared/spoolman-integration.md)):

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 POLL=1
```

Expected console output:
```
NFC gate 0: spool 42 detected (UID 04AABBCCDD). Sending to Happy Hare.
```

This runs the full chain: PN532 read → Spoolman lookup → state update → Happy Hare macro. If this works, the pipeline is complete.

---

## Step 6 — Enable Background Polling

Once a lane works end-to-end, start automatic polling:

```gcode
NFC_GATE NAME=lane0 READ=1
```

To start all lanes, run `READ=1` for each. Polling runs at the `poll_interval` (default: 30 seconds).

**Optional: automatic polling on startup.**
By default, polling is manual-start only. To have lanes start polling automatically after Klipper boots, set `startup_polling: 1` in `pn532_i2C.cfg`. Stagger the startup delays so all readers don't poll simultaneously:

```ini
[nfc_gate lane0]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 0.0

[nfc_gate lane1]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 2.0

[nfc_gate lane2]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 4.0

[nfc_gate lane3]
startup_polling:    1
startup_poll_delay: 6.0
```
